# Sushi Belt Game
Sushi Belt game is a game implemented in java and demonstrates multiple design patterns such as decorator and model, view, controller. The game has you running a sushi shop where you can make custom sushi rolls and serve them to customers by placing them on conveyor belts. Your goal is to try and make more money than the AI opponents who are also producing different kinds of sushi. 

## Installation
To install, you can just download the files and run the sushigame class in Assignment9/sushigame/game

## What I did for this game
This was a semester long project, where each week, I would add functionality to what started as just a sushi class until everything game together to make this game. I wrote the code for the sushi, sashimi and nigiri classes, along with the properties for all of the different fish and ingredients. I also implemented the model, view, controller design pattern and decorator for the plate class. The GUI used for the game, as well as all of its features were also part of the work I did for this project.
